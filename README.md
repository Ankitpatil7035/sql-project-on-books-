Library Management System is intended to Automat the library activities such as creating a new
member, giving books to the members, maintaining the details of available books. This also
helps the librarians by providing information such as total copies available each book, list of
books that belong to a particular category, books taken by members, the date on which they
took that particular book, expected date of return, late due fees, membership details etc.
